# Introduction

I have always been interested in how hashing algorithms work. For this puprose I have created my own hashing tool.

This hashing tool uses a very simple approach by taking each character as input and one by one using each character to create an XOR operation and rotating the result after, this creates quite a random string. This hashing algorithm can be mostly used for creating a checksum.
